Description

Our goal is to build a study group finder for CU students. Computer science courses preach about the importance of collaboration among students for group projects and homework, and our group feels that it is a critical skill to have. While this may not be a problem for students who either already have friends in the class or are naturally outgoing, students who are either shy or awkward may feel excluded. Our project wishes to remedy this by creating a simple interface for CU students to create or locate study groups for their registered classes.

Since the Computer Science department values collaboration and helped give us the idea for the project, our group wants to start on a smaller scale and focus primarily on CSCI classes and see how well we can scale from there. Our project will require students to sign in with their @colorado.edu email, and when registered will ask which CS classes the student is currently in. Each class will have a calendar that will show study groups that have already been created as well as important information such as location and expected size of the group. The user will also be able to create their own study groups.

Vision Statement

To promote communication, collaboration and computation in CU's Community.

Motivation

To get the word out and form study groups for CU classes, especially for people who aren’t the most social in class. The computer science workload feels like it is designed to be completed in small groups, and our group and project hope to help CU students complete their schoolwork more efficiently, and in the process meet new people in interested in their respective fields.

Risks

Workload from course’s project and required assignments.

Workload from other classes.

Currently little front end development and angular experience.

Risk Mitigation Plan

Go to class!

There are incredible amounts of online resources and tutorials that could help along the road.

Frameworks exists, so we can reference resources as we go.

Version Control

Github repository

Development Method

Agile:

Weekly sprints with a scrum master. (Tuesdays at 2pm)

Updates on problems and possible new features to add.

Collaboration tools Slack for communication between the group and its members

Potentially kanban or other task management tools Update (Trello board set up)

Proposed Architecture:

Backend: SQL

Frontend: HTML/CSS, Javascript (possible Angular)

Communicate: PHP

Technologies for which functionalities:

	Database: SQL

	Interface: HTML/CSS, Javascript
